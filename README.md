Patchbay is a websockets-based API backend for our react & redux-based [webapp](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp). Patchbay carries react _actions_ onto the server, allowing duplexed communication between webapp clients & the react server. The server is able to fire native react actions that redux will handle. We use this for reporting the progress of backend services like the completion of [task_mgmt tasks](https://github.com/datatogether/task_mgmt) via a redis pub-sub connection, leave open the option for cross-user interactions using patchbay as the coordinating server.

We structure this entire websocket integration as a protocol upgrade above the [api service](https://github.com/datatogether/api). From the webapp perspective, it should be possible to have patchbay explode in a glorious ball of fire, and fall back to using api endpoints without interruption to the user.

## Usage & Development

Because patchbay supports actions defined in [webapp](https://github.com/datatogether/webapp), the two repos are tightly coupled. The best way to see & work with patchbay is to run is as a backing service for webapp. Webapp development instructions are a great way to get started!
